**Tips for a Successful Food Drive** **Plan Ahead**

* Get other people, particularly senior management, administrators, organization officers, *teachers, friends and/or neighbors committed to the drive.* Choose a theme or name for your drive (for example: “Tons of Tuna,” “Oodles of Noodles,” “Halloween Trick or Trunk”).  Set a goal for how many pounds of food, how many cans or the dollar amount you will collect.
