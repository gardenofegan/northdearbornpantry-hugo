**Organize a Food Drive!**
Food drives play an important role in North Dearborn Pantry’s mission to alleviate hunger in our area. Schools, businesses, youth groups, service organizations, theater and arts groups, places of worship, neighborhood groups, and groups of friends and families have all conducted successful food drives to benefit people at risk of hunger, and so can you!

**Tips for a Successful Food Drive**
**Plan Ahead**

* Get other people, particularly senior management, administrators, organization officers, _teachers, friends and/or neighbors committed to the drive._ Choose a theme or name for your drive (for example: “Tons of Tuna,” “Oodles of Noodles,” “Halloween Trick or Trunk”).  Set a goal for how many pounds of food, how many cans or the dollar amount you will collect.

**Promote the Drive**

* Schedule a fun kick-off event. _Educate your group about the issue of hunger._ Decorate a container to hold donated food. _Place posters and flyers in highly visible places._ Distribute memos or send letters to parents, neighbors, area businesses, etc. _Include flyers with employee paychecks._ Set up a collection schedule to collect certain types of food on specific days or during _designated weeks._ Provide each person with a bag to fill with food.  Issue reminders throughout the drive.
